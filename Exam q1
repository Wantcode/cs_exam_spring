1)  Consider the following class:

--------------------------------------------------------
public class Technology{
   
  String name;
  
  public Technology(String name){
    this.name=name;}
    
  public void speak(){
    System.out.println("Bleep, blip.  I am a " + name);}
    
---------------------------------------------------------    

a)  Write a subclass to Technology with a class called Smartphone.
    Add an additional integer field called number.
    Include a constructor for Smartphone that takes the "name" and "number" as parameters.
    
    public class Smartphone extends Technology{
     int number;
     public Smartphone(String name, int number){
     Super(name);
     this.number=number;}
     public void speak(){System.out.println("My phone number is "+ number);}
     }

b)  Explain what INHERITANCE is.

Inheritance is that it inherits all the fields and methods that the methods have to its subclass when there are class and subclass.

c)  Write a "speak" method for Smartphone that states the "name" and "number".  
public void speak2(){
Smartphone you= new Smartphone();
you.speak;
Technology(speak);
}
d)  What is this called when we write a subclass method which overrides a super class method?
polymorphism
